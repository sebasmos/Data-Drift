> **TL;DR:** ICU severity scores (OASIS, SAPS-II, APS-III, SOFA) drift differently across demographic subgroups. We analyze 809,017 ICU admissions across 4 primary + 2 supplementary datasets from the US, Europe, and Asia (2001-2022) to quantify these disparities.

---

## Core Hypothesis

> **Model drift affects demographic subgroups NON-UNIFORMLY.** This has critical implications for clinical decision-making and suggests that uniform recalibration strategies would fail to address subgroup-specific disparities.

### Why This Matters

Traditional model monitoring tracks *overall* performance degradation. But our analysis reveals that:

1. **Young and elderly patients experience OPPOSITE drift directions** — a pattern consistent across US, European, and Asian datasets
2. **The same subgroup can improve in one healthcare system while declining in another**
3. **A single recalibration factor applied uniformly would help one group while harming another**

---

## Quick Start

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (`pip install uv`)
- Dataset CSVs in `data/` folder (see [Data README](data/README.md) for setup)

### Linux/macOS
```bash
# Setup environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run full pipeline (see Bootstrap Configuration below)
./run_all.sh --fast       # Fast testing (~1 min)
./run_all.sh              # Default (~15 min)
./run_all.sh -b 1000      # Production (~2-4 hours)

# Or run individual steps
./run_all.sh --setup      # Only setup environment
./run_all.sh --analysis   # Only run analysis
./run_all.sh --figures    # Only generate figures
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Setup environment
uv venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run analysis (see Bootstrap Configuration below)
python code/batch_analysis.py --fast        # Fast testing (~1 min)
python code/batch_analysis.py               # Default (~15 min)
python code/batch_analysis.py -b 1000       # Production (~2-4 hours)

python code/supplementary_analysis.py --fast
python code/generate_all_figures.py

# Or use Git Bash to run the shell script
bash run_all.sh --fast
```

### Bootstrap Configuration

The analysis computes bootstrap confidence intervals for AUC values. The number of bootstrap iterations (`N_BOOTSTRAP`) controls:
- **Accuracy**: More iterations = more accurate confidence intervals
- **Runtime**: More iterations = longer runtime

| Mode | Iterations | Runtime (all datasets) | Use Case |
|------|------------|------------------------|----------|
| `--fast` | 2 | ~1 minute | Testing, debugging |
| Default | 100 | ~15 minutes | Development |
| `-b 1000` | 1000 | ~2-4 hours | Production, publication |

```bash
# Examples
python code/batch_analysis.py --fast           # 2 iterations
python code/batch_analysis.py                  # 100 iterations (default)
python code/batch_analysis.py --bootstrap 500  # 500 iterations
python code/batch_analysis.py -b 1000          # 1000 iterations
```

### SOFA Subgroup Drift (Primary Metric)

SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) is used as the primary metric for subgroup analysis due to its widespread clinical use and availability across all datasets.

| Dataset | Subgroup Type | Most Affected Subgroup | SOFA Δ | Direction |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|--------|-----------|
| **MIMIC Combined** | Age | 18-44 (Young) | **+0.080*** | Improving |
| | Gender | Female | **+0.039*** | Improving |
| | Race | White | **+0.046*** | Improving |
| **eICU Combined** | Age | 80+ (Elderly) | **+0.044*** | Improving |
| | Gender | Female | **+0.028*** | Improving |
| | Race | Hispanic | **-0.039*** | Degrading |
| **Saltz** | Age | 45-64 | +0.057 | Stable |
| | Gender | Male | +0.034 | Stable |
| **Zhejiang** | Age | 80+ | +0.141 | Improving |
| | Gender | Female | +0.058 | Stable |

*SOFA = Sequential Organ Failure Assessment. Selected as primary metric due to widespread clinical adoption and consistent availability across all ICU datasets.*

*Figure 6: Three-panel summary of SOFA ≥ 10 threshold metrics across all datasets: (A) AUC drift over time, (B) SMR calibration drift, (C) Fairness metrics heatmap*

**Key Classification & Calibration Findings:**
- SOFA ≥ 10 threshold corresponds to ~40% mortality (JAMA 2001)
- TPR (Sensitivity) and PPV vary significantly across age groups and time
- SMR (Standardized Mortality Ratio) drift indicates calibration changes over time
- Brier score captures both discrimination and calibration performance

**Key Fairness Findings:**
- Demographic parity difference measures prediction rate disparities across groups
- Equalized odds difference captures TPR/FPR disparities across protected groups
- Cross-dataset patterns reveal consistent fairness concerns in certain subgroups

---

## Clinical Implications

1. **Uniform recalibration is insufficient** - different subgroups need different adjustments
2. **Geographic context matters** - the same subgroup can experience opposite drift in different healthcare systems
3. **Age-specific models may be needed** - the consistent age divergence pattern suggests fundamental differences in how scores perform across age groups

## Methodology

### Analysis Approach: Per-Dataset Analysis

> **Important:** Each dataset is analyzed **independently**. We do NOT make cross-dataset statistical comparisons (e.g., "MIMIC drift is greater than Saltz drift"). Instead, we:
>
> 1. Analyze drift within each dataset using its own temporal bins
> 2. Report per-dataset results separately in `output/{dataset}/` directories
> 3. Visually compare patterns across datasets to identify **consistent themes** (e.g., age divergence appears in multiple regions)
>
> This approach respects the fundamental differences between datasets (patient populations, healthcare systems, data collection methods) while allowing us to identify recurring patterns of non-uniform drift.

### Severity Scores Analyzed

| Score | Components | Range |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **OASIS** | 10 variables (age, GCS, vitals, ventilation, etc.) | 0-47 |
| **SAPS-II** | 17 variables (age, vitals, labs, chronic conditions) | 0-163 |
| **APS-III** | 20 variables (similar to APACHE III) | 0-299 |
| **SOFA** | 6 organ systems (respiratory, cardiovascular, etc.) | 0-24 |
| **APACHE** | Acute physiology + chronic health evaluation | 0-299 |

### Score Availability by Dataset

> **Note:** APACHE scores are only available in eICU datasets. APACHE is a proprietary scoring system primarily used in US multi-center ICU networks.

| Dataset | SOFA | OASIS | SAPS-II | APS-III | APACHE |
|---------|:----:|:-----:|:-------:|:-------:|:------:|
| MIMIC Combined | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| eICU Combined | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Saltz | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Zhejiang | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Data loading**: Standardize demographics across datasets
2. **Subgroup stratification**: Age (18-44, 45-64, 65-79, 80+), Gender, Race/Ethnicity
3. **AUC computation**: Score discrimination for mortality prediction per time period
4. **Drift quantification**: Delta AUC between first and last time periods
5. **Statistical testing**: DeLong's test for significance of AUC differences

### Statistical Methods

| Method | Purpose | Implementation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Bootstrap CIs** | Confidence intervals for AUC | Percentile method, stratified resampling (n=100-1000) |
| **DeLong's test** | Compare AUCs between time periods | Hanley-McNeil variance approximation, two-tailed z-test |
| **Significance** | Identify reliable drift | p < 0.05 (DeLong's test) or 95% CI excludes 0 |

#### What Does DeLong's Test Tell You?

DeLong's test answers: **"Is the observed AUC change real, or just random noise?"**

- **p < 0.05** → The drift is statistically significant (unlikely due to chance)
- **p ≥ 0.05** → The drift could be random variation (insufficient evidence)

**Example interpretation from our results:**

| Finding | Δ AUC | p-value | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|
| MIMIC Combined Asian APS-III | +0.148 | 0.008 | **Real improvement** — only 0.8% chance this is random |
| Saltz Overall SOFA | +0.034 | 0.28 | **Not significant** — 28% chance this is just noise |

### Care Phenotypes: A Novel Proxy for Intersectional Demographics

Care phenotypes represent a novel approach using **nursing care intensity patterns** as a proxy for unmeasured intersectional factors (socioeconomic status, insurance, language barriers). See [Care Phenotypes Documentation](docs/care_phenotypes.md) for details.

**Key insight:** Patients with low care frequency (Q4) may represent a disadvantaged phenotype that experiences worse score calibration.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

- [ ] **Calibration analysis**: Assess calibration drift (Brier score, calibration curves) alongside discrimination
- [ ] **Intersectional analysis**: Examine combinations (e.g., elderly Hispanic patients) for compounded disparities
- [ ] **Care phenotype expansion**: Apply care phenotype methodology to additional datasets and nursing interventions

### Extended Analysis

- [ ] **Recalibration strategies**: Test subgroup-specific recalibration approaches (not uniform!)
- [ ] **Feature importance**: Identify which score components drive subgroup-specific drift
- [ ] **External validation**: Apply findings to additional datasets (ANZICS, UK ICU)
- [ ] **Temporal granularity**: Monthly/quarterly drift analysis for datasets with sufficient data

### Clinical Translation

- [ ] **Decision threshold analysis**: How drift affects clinical decisions at specific score cutoffs
- [ ] **Fairness metrics**: Compute equalized odds, demographic parity across subgroups
- [ ] **Intervention simulation**: Model impact of periodic recalibration on patient outcomes
- [ ] **Clinical guidelines**: Recommendations for score interpretation by subgroup
