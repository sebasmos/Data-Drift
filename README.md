> **TL;DR:** ICU severity scores (OASIS, SAPS-II, APS-III, SOFA) drift differently across demographic subgroups. We analyze 809,017 ICU admissions across 4 primary + 2 supplementary datasets from the US, Europe, and Asia (2001-2022) to quantify these disparities.

---

## Core Hypothesis

> **Model drift affects demographic subgroups NON-UNIFORMLY.** This has critical implications for clinical decision-making and suggests that uniform recalibration strategies would fail to address subgroup-specific disparities.

### Why This Matters

Traditional model monitoring tracks *overall* performance degradation. But our analysis reveals that:

1. **Young and elderly patients experience OPPOSITE drift directions** — a pattern consistent across US, European, and Asian datasets
2. **The same subgroup can improve in one healthcare system while declining in another**
3. **A single recalibration factor applied uniformly would help one group while harming another**

## Quick Start

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (`pip install uv`)

### Linux/macOS
```bash
# Setup environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run full pipeline (see Bootstrap Configuration below)
./run_all.sh --fast       # Fast testing (~1 min)
./run_all.sh              # Default (~15 min)
./run_all.sh -b 1000      # Production (~2-4 hours)

# Or run individual steps
./run_all.sh --setup      # Only setup environment
./run_all.sh --analysis   # Only run analysis
./run_all.sh --figures    # Only generate figures
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Setup environment
uv venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run analysis (see Bootstrap Configuration below)
python code/batch_analysis.py --fast        # Fast testing (~1 min)
python code/batch_analysis.py               # Default (~15 min)
python code/batch_analysis.py -b 1000       # Production (~2-4 hours)

python code/supplementary_analysis.py --fast
python code/generate_all_figures.py

# Or use Git Bash to run the shell script
bash run_all.sh --fast
```

### Bootstrap Configuration

The analysis computes bootstrap confidence intervals for AUC values. The number of bootstrap iterations (`N_BOOTSTRAP`) controls:
- **Accuracy**: More iterations = more accurate confidence intervals
- **Runtime**: More iterations = longer runtime

| Mode | Iterations | Runtime (all datasets) | Use Case |
|------|------------|------------------------|----------|
| `--fast` | 2 | ~1 minute | Testing, debugging |
| Default | 100 | ~15 minutes | Development |
| `-b 1000` | 1000 | ~2-4 hours | Production, publication |

```bash
# Examples
python code/batch_analysis.py --fast           # 2 iterations
python code/batch_analysis.py                  # 100 iterations (default)
python code/batch_analysis.py --bootstrap 500  # 500 iterations
python code/batch_analysis.py -b 1000          # 1000 iterations
```

## Clinical Implications

1. **Uniform recalibration is insufficient** - different subgroups need different adjustments
2. **Geographic context matters** - the same subgroup can experience opposite drift in different healthcare systems
3. **Age-specific models may be needed** - the consistent age divergence pattern suggests fundamental differences in how scores perform across age groups

## Methodology

### Analysis Approach: Per-Dataset Analysis

> **Important:** Each dataset is analyzed **independently**. We do NOT make cross-dataset statistical comparisons (e.g., "MIMIC drift is greater than Saltz drift"). Instead, we:
>
> 1. Analyze drift within each dataset using its own temporal bins
> 2. Report per-dataset results separately in `output/{dataset}/` directories
> 3. Visually compare patterns across datasets to identify **consistent themes** (e.g., age divergence appears in multiple regions)
>
> This approach respects the fundamental differences between datasets (patient populations, healthcare systems, data collection methods) while allowing us to identify recurring patterns of non-uniform drift.

### Severity Scores Analyzed

| Score | Components | Range |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **OASIS** | 10 variables (age, GCS, vitals, ventilation, etc.) | 0-47 |
| **SAPS-II** | 17 variables (age, vitals, labs, chronic conditions) | 0-163 |
| **APS-III** | 20 variables (similar to APACHE III) | 0-299 |
| **SOFA** | 6 organ systems (respiratory, cardiovascular, etc.) | 0-24 |
| **APACHE** | Acute physiology + chronic health evaluation | 0-299 |

### Score Availability by Dataset

> **Note:** APACHE scores are only available in eICU datasets. APACHE is a proprietary scoring system primarily used in US multi-center ICU networks.

| Dataset | SOFA | OASIS | SAPS-II | APS-III | APACHE |
|---------|:----:|:-----:|:-------:|:-------:|:------:|
| MIMIC Combined | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| eICU Combined | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Saltz | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Zhejiang | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Data loading**: Standardize demographics across datasets
2. **Subgroup stratification**: Age (18-44, 45-64, 65-79, 80+), Gender, Race/Ethnicity
3. **AUC computation**: Score discrimination for mortality prediction per time period
4. **Drift quantification**: Delta AUC between first and last time periods
5. **Statistical testing**: DeLong's test for significance of AUC differences

### Statistical Methods

| Method | Purpose | Implementation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Bootstrap CIs** | Confidence intervals for AUC | Percentile method, stratified resampling (n=100-1000) |
| **DeLong's test** | Compare AUCs between time periods | Hanley-McNeil variance approximation, two-tailed z-test |
| **Significance** | Identify reliable drift | p < 0.05 (DeLong's test) or 95% CI excludes 0 |

#### What Does DeLong's Test Tell You?

DeLong's test answers: **"Is the observed AUC change real, or just random noise?"**

- **p < 0.05** → The drift is statistically significant (unlikely due to chance)
- **p ≥ 0.05** → The drift could be random variation (insufficient evidence)

**Example interpretation from our results:**

| Finding | Δ AUC | p-value | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|
| MIMIC Combined Asian APS-III | +0.148 | 0.008 | **Real improvement** — only 0.8% chance this is random |
| Saltz Overall SOFA | +0.034 | 0.28 | **Not significant** — 28% chance this is just noise |

## Supplementary Analysis

### Care Phenotypes: A Novel Proxy for Intersectional Demographics

Care phenotypes represent a novel approach using **nursing care intensity patterns** as a proxy for unmeasured intersectional factors (socioeconomic status, insurance, language barriers). See [Care Phenotypes Documentation](docs/care_phenotypes.md) for details.

**Key insight:** Patients with low care frequency (Q4) may represent a disadvantaged phenotype that experiences worse score calibration.

#### COVID-19 Era Analysis (eICU Combined 2020-2021)

> **Note:** This analysis is specific to eICU Combined which includes data from the COVID-19 pandemic period (2020-2021).

**Racial/Ethnic Disparities during COVID-19 Era:**

| Subgroup | OASIS Δ | SOFA Δ | APS-III Δ | APACHE Δ |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Hispanic | **-0.117*** | **-0.039*** | **-0.104*** | **-0.092*** |
| Black | **-0.069*** | -0.002 | **-0.125*** | **-0.030*** |
| Asian | -0.022 | **+0.101*** | **-0.104*** | -0.021 |
| White | **-0.027*** | **+0.012*** | **-0.091*** | **-0.045*** |

*The COVID-era eICU data (2020-2021) shows pervasive score degradation (78% of comparisons significant), with Hispanic and Black patients experiencing the largest declines in several scores.*

**Gender Differences during COVID-19 Era:**

| Region | Dataset | Male (OASIS) | Female (OASIS) | Pattern |
|--------|---------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Europe | Saltz | +0.069 | +0.006 | Males improve 10x more |
| Asia | Zhejiang | +0.030 | +0.082 | Females improve 3x more |
| US | MIMIC Combined | +0.017 | -0.006 | Males improve, females decline |
| US | eICU Combined | **-0.038*** | **-0.034*** | Both decline significantly |


## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

- [ ] **Calibration analysis**: Assess calibration drift (Brier score, calibration curves) alongside discrimination
- [ ] **Intersectional analysis**: Examine combinations (e.g., elderly Hispanic patients) for compounded disparities
- [ ] **Care phenotype expansion**: Apply care phenotype methodology to additional datasets and nursing interventions

### Extended Analysis

- [ ] **Recalibration strategies**: Test subgroup-specific recalibration approaches (not uniform!)
- [ ] **Feature importance**: Identify which score components drive subgroup-specific drift
- [ ] **External validation**: Apply findings to additional datasets (ANZICS, UK ICU)
- [ ] **Temporal granularity**: Monthly/quarterly drift analysis for datasets with sufficient data

### Clinical Translation

- [ ] **Decision threshold analysis**: How drift affects clinical decisions at specific score cutoffs
- [ ] **Fairness metrics**: Compute equalized odds, demographic parity across subgroups
- [ ] **Intervention simulation**: Model impact of periodic recalibration on patient outcomes
- [ ] **Clinical guidelines**: Recommendations for score interpretation by subgroup
